# DevToolTracker

This repository contains a structured **Java learning journay**, broken into weeks, with exercises, projects, and mini-apps built to develop core skills.

Each folder ('Week_1', etc.) corresponds to a specific learning module.
Main idea of this month is the **Week_4 mini-project**: 'DevToolTracker' 👇🏻

## 📚 Repository Structure
Learning_Java_Summer/
 - Week_1 Java Basics, OOP, Strings, Arrays
 - Week_2 Exceptions, Collections, Java 8
 - Week_3 File I/O, MVC, Generics, Streams
 - Week_4 DevToolTracker project (MVC mini app)


## 🔧 DevToolTracker (Week 4 Project)

A **console-based Java application** to track your developer tools (languages, frameworks, platforms, etc.)  
It uses OOP principles, Enums, Collections, Stream API, and follows the MVC architecture.

### 🎯 Features

- Add new dev tools (e.g. Java, Spring, GitHub)
- Set their category: `LANGUAGE`, `FRAMEWORK`, `LIBRARY`, etc.
- Assign a `rating` and `learning status` (PLANNED, LEARNING, MASTERED)
- Filter tools by status
- Sort by rating
- Find the most important tool
- Structured in **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**

## 🧠 Technologies

- Java 17
- Collections: `List`, `Optional`
- Enums
- Streams and Lambdas
- MVC Pattern


### ❤️ Why This Exists
This repo is a reflection of my commitment to mastering Java step by step.
The weekly structure helps track progress. The final project (DevToolTracker) is a growing app I plan to evolve and improve over time.
